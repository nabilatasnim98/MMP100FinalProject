        <h2>Ribbit & Co.</h2>

        <!-- Panel 1 -->
        <div>
            <p>[Scene: A serene pond with lily pads. Ribbit, a quirky frog wearing glasses, sits on a lily pad with a book titled "Frogosophy." Nearby, Co., a mischievous frog, hides behind a bush.]</p>
            <p>Ribbit: "Ah, the joy of reading by the pond."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Panel 2 -->
        <div>
            <p>[Co. sneaks up, wearing a fake mustache and a bowler hat, trying to impersonate Ribbit.]</p>
            <p>Co.: "I am Ribbit! Watch me croak and read at the same time!"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Panel 3 -->
        <div>
            <p>[Ribbit looks bemused as Co. hops around doing a bizarre impression, causing nearby frogs to laugh.]</p>
            <p>Ribbit: "Co., that's not... remotely accurate."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Panel 4 -->
        <div>
            <p>[Co. falls into the pond, glasses askew, and Ribbit laughs heartily.]</p>
            <p>Ribbit: "Looks like someone just took a dive into comedy!"</p>
